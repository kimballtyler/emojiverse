# Emojiverse

A Twitter-like app with a twist. Instead of using words, you communicate with emojis. This project is all about creating this fun and innovative emoji-only Twitter clone using the T3 stack, which includes Next.js, Prisma, PlanetScale, and trpc. It's designed to be accessible to developers of all levels, and the services used offer generous free tiers for easy access. This was my first time using many of these technologies!

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.
